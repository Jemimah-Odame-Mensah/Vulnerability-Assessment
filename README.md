# Vulnerability Assessment for an E-Commerce Business

## Project Overview

As part of my cybersecurity training, I conducted a comprehensive vulnerability assessment for a small e-commerce business. The purpose of the project was to evaluate the security risks of a publicly accessible database server that stored sensitive information. This assessment focused on identifying threats, assessing potential risks, and proposing effective security measures to protect the company’s critical data.

## Scenario

I assumed the role of a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company that relied on a remote database server for operations, particularly because employees worked from various global locations. The database, which had been open to the public since the company’s launch, posed a significant risk to business operations. My task was to complete a vulnerability assessment and communicate the risks to decision-makers, offering solutions to secure the server.


## Steps

The project was divided into three main parts:

### 1. Risk Assessment:

- Reviewed the system description and scope to gain an understanding of the database server's architecture and vulnerabilities.
- Evaluated the purpose of the information system, determining how its availability, confidentiality, and integrity affected the company's business processes.
- Identified three potential threat sources and corresponding threat events using the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 framework.
- Assessed the likelihood and severity of these threats to estimate overall risk scores.

### 2. Qualitative Vulnerability Assessment:

- Conducted a subjective analysis to judge the probability and impact of potential attacks, ensuring the most critical risks were highlighted to stakeholders.
- Explained the reasoning behind selecting specific threat sources and events, and provided context for the significance of each risk to the business.

### 3. Remediation Strategy:

- Developed and proposed a remediation plan to address the identified risks. Security recommendations included implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA), enforcing the principle of least privilege, and enhancing defense-in-depth strategies.
- Suggested security controls and mitigation strategies for risks that could not be completely eliminated.

## Outcome and Learnings

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in conducting vulnerability assessments, applying industry standards, and making security recommendations that aligned with business goals. The final report provided a clear, actionable plan for improving the security posture of the e-commerce company by addressing its most critical vulnerabilities.
